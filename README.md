# How I Used RFM Analysis to Craft Smarter Promotion Strategies
**Overview**<br>
As someone working in marketing analytics, Iâ€™ve always been curious about how to turn raw customer data into concrete strategies. I wanted to explore how RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis could help businesses better understand customer behaviorâ€”and more importantly, how those insights could be translated into **actionable, segment-specific promotional strategies**.<br>
The project simulates a real-world e-commerce scenario, where sending generic promotions to everyone may waste budget and miss opportunities. Instead, by scoring and segmenting customers using RFM metrics, we aim to **target the right customer with the right message**, improving both customer experience and marketing efficiency.

**ðŸŽ¯ Objective**<br>
To guide this analysis, I set out to answer key business questions:
- What does our customer landscape look like based on RFM segmentation?
- Which customer segments are the most valuable?
- How many customers are at risk of churningâ€”and how can we win them back?
- What kind of targeted promotions make sense for each segment?

**ðŸ“¦ Dataset**<br>
The project uses transactional data that includes:
- `Customer ID`
- `Transaction Date`
- `Purchase Quantity`
- `Revenue Amount`

**ðŸ”Ž Key Steps**
1. Data cleaning and transformation
2. Calculating RFM scores for each customer
3. Assigning customer segments based on score combinations
4. Visualizing segment distribution and contributions to revenue
5. Generating strategic recommendations for each group
